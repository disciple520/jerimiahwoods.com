                  Our team performed four one-week sprints. The following is anonymous feedback given to our instructor when the project was over. (We were required to evaluate each team member's performance.) He then passed the feedback on to us. Here is what I recieved, verbatim:<br><br>
                  <span class="subheading feedback-subheading">Strengths</span><br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>This team member’s strengths are that they are very open to learning new things. He always wants to try new things to help further a project along, and to learn things to help his career. He is very good at working with others as well.</li>
                    <li>Jerry is a great team player. He makes sure he gets his tasks done but also makes sure that everyone around him is succeeding as well. I still think Jerry is great with programming because he can look at the code and access what it is trying to accomplish rather than how it is trying to accomplish if that makes any sense.</li>
                    <li>Jerry is very active in all aspects of this project, his questions and discussion about the stories and everything helped a lot in understanding how to handle a lot about this project. He was the member that was most helpful however he could and when he could.</li>
                    <li>He’s a great team member to work with, very helpful and has a big influence towards decisions and to go about much of the stories and he’ll be a huge steal for whoever else he works for as he’ll be an amazing team member.</li>
                    <li>Jerry did a good job of taking on tasks that would improve his knowledge. He also did a great job of trying to keep the team on track over the course of this project.</li>
                  </ul><br>
                  <span class="subheading feedback-subheading">Areas to improve</span>
                  <ul>
                    <li>I think that he could improve by asking more questions of each of the team members. I think that he understands at some level how our team worked but some clarifying questions about what each member was doing would help a lot.</li>
                    <li>Jerry took a much stronger position in the team after the midterm review. I still think he could stand his ground a little </li>
                    <li>Jerry just needs to work on keeping in touch a bit more so we know more of how he’s doing outside of the meetings we have.</li>
                    <li>Jerry could try to pair with more than just one team member to try and learn from them as well.</li>
                  </ul><br>
                  (Note: I only had four team members, so I believe that my instructor Brian Hogan wrote the fifth bullet point under 'strengths.')<br><br>
